2. **Create a concise summary** focusing on main points and key information
3. **Extract important keywords** (up to 10) - terms that represent main topics, concepts, and themes
4. **Analyze sentiment** - determine overall tone (positive/negative/neutral), confidence level, and emotions present
5. **Identify document characteristics** - type, complexity level, and key themes
6. **Provide actionable insights** - key takeaways valuable for business decision-making
7. **Suggest action items** - specific next steps or recommendations
